This application allows you to create, view, edit, and delete notes and their titles, all stored in a local JSON database. It was built with React and JSON Server.

2. Install library dependencies using `npm install`
3. Start JSON Server using `npm run json`
4. Start the application using `npm start`

The app should now be running at `localhost:3000/`

The API will be running at `localhost:8000/notes`

## Reflection

I was given 3 days to complete this project as part of the interview process for Boomtown. The requirements included being able to add, edit, and delete notes. It also needed to have a self-contained database, and in my case, I used a JSON file.

I really enjoyed working on this project because it allowed me to get more familiar with React and web development as a whole.

The technologies I used in this project are React, React-Router v6, JSON Server, and CSS. I also used `create-react-app` to jumpstart my development.
